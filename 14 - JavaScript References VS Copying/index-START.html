    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    //we get 100, 100;
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);
    //we get 200, 100; as expected.

    //Try with a string:
    let name = 'Eric'
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    //we get Eric, Eric;
    name = 'Zell';
    console.log(name, name2);
    //we get Zell, Eric; as expected.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);
    //WE GET LUX IN BOTH PLAYERS AND TEAM!!!!
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'Tony';
    console.log(players, team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = 'Boss';
    console.log(players, team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = "Frank";
    console.log(players, team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Eric Zell',
      age: 80
    };
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person); // Person now has number 99!! It's a reference, not a copy!!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 85});
    console.log(person);
    console.log(person2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const eric = {
      name: "Eric",
      age: 31,
      social: {
        twitter: '@ez_codes',
        facebook: 'ericjzell18'
      }
    };

    console.log(eric);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, eric);
    dev.age = 100;
    console.log('Eric:');
    console.log(eric);
    console.log('Dev');
    console.log(dev); //Eric's age is still 31 because we made a copy!

    // Object.assign copy is very shallow, i.e. it only goes one level deep:

    dev.social.twitter = '@haha_dude';
    console.log('Eric:');
    console.log(eric);
    console.log('Dev');
    console.log(dev); //It updates Eric's twitter attribute also!
    //We can search web for deep clone function, or use poor man's cheap clone:
    //which is convert the object to json string then back to json (non performant though)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(eric));

    dev2.social.facebook = "Mitch";

    console.log('Eric:');
    console.log(eric);
    console.log('Dev2');
    console.log(dev2); //Now, updating the nested attribute only affects the dev2 copy.
